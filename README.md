This is a base app, a great start point to init a functional latest app with:

- Nextjs
- NextAuthjs
- bcryptjs
- mongoose

This app uses credentials method to login users, also it is a private access app, that means that signup is restricted to only members that the client want to register.

All this was created following the video tutorial from Fazt Code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9l7vUWzw1I

Thanks to fazt to show this practical guide.
